The BDFL (Benevolent Dictator For Life) of our project is Dmitry (@Dmitry-Love), and the final word on all matters rests with him. Our primary maintainers who can approve pull requests are Ilya (@pestovid) and Maksim (@MerelyOneMax1986). The BDFL can only be chosen when a consensus is reached among maintainers, including the BDFL.

Any disagreements within the project team are resolved through forking and splitting the team. Changing the contribution rules can also only be done through a consensus among maintainers, including the BDFL.

Dmitry, as the BDFL, single-handedly wrote the initial version and assembled the project team, earning his status and high trust. Everyone who joins the Sinara community is obligated to adhere to these rules without question.
